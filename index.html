  <h5 class="text-succsess text-capitalize">Was established in 1978</h5>
  <p class="text-muted">The Apsáalooke people had occasional contact with the Jesuits beginning in 1840, including Father Pierre Jean DeSmet, the first “Black Robe” to visit what is now the State of Montana. By 1880 other Jesuits arrived to evangelize the reservation; they established a permanent mission here in February 1887. Fathers Peter Prando and Peter Bandini resided in a tent before constructing the first permanent building at St. Xavier, a two-story boarding school (which is no longer standing), staffed by Ursuline nuns. Construction of the 1888 rectory and a wooden Gothic style church soon followed. Money to build the church came from Philadelphia heiress Katherine Drexel, who founded the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament and donated her entire fortune to mission work. An excellent linguist, Father Prando soon translated hymns, Bible stories, and the catechism into Crow.

    However, the Jesuits saw the school as their best tool for gaining converts—both among the pupils and their parents. Punishments at the school could be harsh, and close-knit Crow families disliked the boarding school system because it took their children away from home. Nevertheless, most parents preferred the mission school to the agency school, and many families established camps nearby in order to see their children as often as possible. The mission also served as an orphanage and hospital; Father Prando particularly was well known as a healer. Eventually, government funding ceased, and the school closed temporarily, reopening as a Catholic day and boarding school. Unlike in the nineteenth century, in 2020, Crow language and culture were part of the curriculum.</p>

      <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>School auditorium</kbd></h4>
      <hr>
      <h5 class="text-succsess text-capitalize">Was established in 1982</h5>
      <p class="text-muted">The stage has always been held in great honour at St. Xavier’s. For an educational institution an auditorium is not just a venue for school or college events, or merely a meeting place, it is a space where a corporation of students and scholars congregate – to celebrate, to debate, to discuss, and sometimes even to mourn collectively. As we stand at the threshold of another century in the history of St. Xavier’s College, it is meet that we go down memory lane and find out how students gathered here when it all began 130 odd years ago, how this place changed over the century, and how it is now poised to provide a space for even greater creative, cultural and social events, something that St. Xavier’s College has always been noted for.

      The growth of the St. Xavier’s Stage and auditorium took place separately in distinct and gradual phases, creating history of its own. The earliest history of the college hall goes back to 1885. The Old College Hall then served as a dormitory for the boarders as well as providing the most convenient place for dramatic performances. After 1885, great occasions, like the Prize Distribution Day, demanded more space than the hall could provide. For these functions a large shamiana was erected in the open.</p>
